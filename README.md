# How to Test
Run the server. Use Postman to test my codes. I test each function of my codes. Two examples of requests are listed here.
This one is to test deleting the contact of jane.

In addition, I checked my emails directly on Gmail and GMX to confirm the outcome.

# How AJAX helps


# Additional Features
## Move Message
I added the feature of moving a message from a mailbox to another. A select component in Material UI is used. The current mailbox will not appear in the list.

## Sort messages with date
In the message list, the email messages are sorted with the latest ones go first.
